# Custom-Testimonial-Block-Wordpress
I have a created a custom block as a plugin that will appear in gutenberg as a widget when activated, containing fields of the testimonial quote, author name, and job title with some CSS customizations and I have added classes to each field so you can customize CSS accordingly. The classes for each field are as follows;
Testimonial quote: class="testimonial-text"
author name:  class="author-name"
job title:    qclass="job-title"
